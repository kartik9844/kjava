2.comparsion operator : this operator are used to compare the values <,>,<=,>=,==,!=.
3.logical operators : this operator are used to combine more than one comparsion operators 
and(&&)
or(||)
not(!=,<>)
 and when all condition are true it will retrn true if any 1 condition fales it return fales.
 or when any 1 condition is true is true it return true when all condition become fales it return fales. not its a oppositie of and when all condition become fales it returns true if any 1 of condition is fales it return fales

LOOP
to repate same statement again and again loops are used by using loops the same set of code can be excuted any number of times
following are the 3 different types of loops supported by java from jdk 1.8 onvards advance looping concept is used by using for each concept
for loop when we know the number of repetation we use for loop for loop is a entery control loop
which checks the cinditions first then the excution starts due this feature is called entery control loop
for loop take 3 parameters  first as start valeue or inital value second parametr as a conditon till the condition s true loop 
will exceute the movement condition false loop will be terminted 3rd as a incremant or decremant

for(start ; condition ;incr/decr)
{
TRUE
------
} 
FALSE -> EXIT
