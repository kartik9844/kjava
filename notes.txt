data types this are used to define varaibles in java folowing are the permitive data types 
int
float
double
char
boolean

condition statements
java suppports 3 types of conditional statements 
if
for
switch
for every condition their will be a 2 possbilities true or fales. if the condition is true the first bock will be ecuqeted if the conditionis fales it will exceute the else part.

syntax
if(condition)
{
true
}
else
{
false
}

13. wp to find the greatest of 2 number
14. wp to check the give number is even or odd

hw 
15.wp to check leap year
16.wp to check the give number is positive or negaitive
17.wp to check is the user is eigible for driving licenses whoes age is 17 years

operators 
this are used to perfrom some operation on a operands for exmaple 3+5 3 and 5 are operands +is a operator following are the some of the operator supported by java
1.arthamatic operator : this operator are used to perfrom mathamatical operation + - / * = ,%.
2.comparsion operator : this operator are used to compare the values <,>,<=,>=,==,!=.
3.logical operators : this operator are used to combine more than one comparsion operators 
and(&&)
or(||)
not(!=,<>)
 and when all condition are true it will retrn true if any 1 condition fales it return fales.
 or when any 1 condition is true is true it return true when all condition become fales it return fales. not its a oppositie of and when all condition become fales it returns true if any 1 of condition is fales it return fales

18.wp to find greatest of 3 numbers
19. wp to display the following messages 
if a number divides by 3 display hello
if number divides by 5 diaplay hi
if number divides by 3 and 5 display hello hi
3,10,15

10.write a program to find the greatest of 5 number
21. write p to display the result with respect to the marks
if the marks is 35 to 50 display parse 
if the marks is 50 to 60 dispay 2nd class
if the makrs is 60to75 first pass
75to 100 distiction else fail
give marks is 45

22. wp to read 3 sides of rectsangle and display what type of rectangle it is

LOOP
to repate same statement again and again loops are used by using loops the same set of code can be excuted any number of times
following are the 3 different types of loops supported by java from jdk 1.8 onvards advance looping concept is used by using for each concept
for loop when we know the number of repetation we use for loop for loop is a entery control loop
which checks the cinditions first then the excution starts due this feature is called entery control loop
for loop take 3 parameters  first as start valeue or inital value second parametr as a conditon till the condition s true loop 
will exceute the movement condition false loop will be terminted 3rd as a incremant or decremant

for(start ; condition ;incr/decr)
{
TRUE
------
} 
FALSE -> EXIT

23.wp to display the number for 1 to 10
24. wp to display the numbers from 20 to 10
25. wp to display all even number from 1 to 20
26. wp to display the sum of 1 to 10
27. wp to display numbers from 1 to 30 which are divisible by 3
28. wp to display the following messages for the range 1 to 30
if the number divideds by 3 display hi
if no divides by 5 display hello
if a number divides by 3 and 5 dispay hi hello

WHILE LOOP 
its a entery contorled loop when we dont know the number of repetations we use this loop in this loop intialization condition incerment or derement are given in seaparet lines first we initiazie the value  then this value will be checked with a condition if the condition is true it will excute the code else it will terminate 

SYNTAX 
Start
while(condition)
{

incr/decr
}

31. wp to display the number from 1 to 10 using while loop
32. wp to read the value from user and display
33. wp to read a 3 digit number and display indivial digits
34. wp to read a number and reverse it
35. wp to read a number and check is it a palindrome
36. wp to read a number and find the sum of indival number
do while loop
its a exit control loop this loop will excute altaest once irespective of errors following example 

37.wp to display all prime number from 1 to 50
38. wp to display fibanoci series upto 15
39. wp to check arm strong (the cube of indivial digits is the same number )
40. wp to read a number and check is it a prime
41.
42.create a class for to store staff information create 2 objects and show the information


contustrs
are the spical type of methods by using a constructor we can assine a delfault for member variable constructor will intilizing the objects in constructor their 2 types 
deafult construcotr 
user defined  constructor


deafult construcotr :
this is created by the jvm at the time of complieation jvm checks for the constructor if the constructor is not defined it will create a constructor by assing a defualt vlaues the following chat show the deafult value of datatypes
int=0
float or double=0.0
string or char= NULL
Boolen=false
43.deafult bvale

user defined constructor :
this are created by user accroding the requriments in user defined constructor their 2 types 
1.default
2. paramatrised

1. default: when we default constructor is created to strore user defined defualt constructor user can assine their own values for the varilaves
2. paramatrised : in paramatrised constructor it is going to take parameters and this paramers will be assinged to the locail vairables

44.write a program to demonstarte user defined constructor 
45.write a program to demonstarte user user defined constructor 
46hw.wp to check is the givien number palidrom or not
47hw.create a array of size 5 store values in it display the second highest no?

Inhertance:
transfer of charaterctics from 1 class to another class is called inhertance following are the different types of inhertances supported by java 

1. simple inhertance: in it only 2 classes will be particpated first class is paraent class 2nd clASS is child class to inhert the features from 1 class to other class we use extenteds key word following example demostartes simple inhertance

48.simple inhertance

2.multileve inhertance:
first class transfer its charaterctics to the second class 2nd to 3rd ,3rd to 4th and so no.
following expample demonstarte multilevel inhertance
49.multileve inhertance:

hierarchial inheritance:
in hierarchial inheritance a single class tranfer its charatericts to a 2 or more class in hierarchial inheritance only 1 super class all other class are sub class following examples demostrate hierarchial inheritance
50.hierarchial inheritance

multiple inheratiance : java doest not supports multiple inheratiance in mutiple inheratiance 2 or more classes will
 inherat the charaterics to a single class this type of inheratance is not supported by java to give a support for 
multiple inhertance java introduced interfaces 

interfaces can be called to a inherated class a single class can inhert any number of interfaces  in


interface:
its a incmplet class its desgined to achive multipe in hertances in java following are the some of the key featuers of 
interfaces 
1. interfaces are defined using the key word interface. its a incompete class interfaces can define only the singnature of 
of method or interface are going to define method names this methods will be implemented or defined in a inherated class
interfaces cannot be excueted 
2. in it we cant define varaibles 
3. in it what ever the methods we define all the methods must be implemented in a inherated class
